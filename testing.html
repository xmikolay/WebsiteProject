                Inside the flagship sedan, the engineers worked just as hard to make it one of the best living spaces in the world. Over 24 types of woods and various 
                leather materials were tested for over two years before finally arriving with a combination they were satisfied with. The California walnut wood and 
                leather were going to be the touchpoints on the vehicles they had to look good and feel good as well. It was also packed with some of the latest luxury 
                features of the time to make the operations as smooth as possible.

                The LS also features 300 extra innovations for smooth operation and improved silence in the cabin. An optional passive air suspension system was also 
                developed the make the ride even smoother. All these resulted in a very quiet cabin of 58 decibels at 60 MPH which was quieter than its equivalent rivals 
                from Mercedes and BMW. All at a cost of just $35,000 when it was launched in 1989. This undercut the competition by a huge margin as the equivalent BMW and 
                Mercedes cost around $60,000 and $70,000 respectively.
