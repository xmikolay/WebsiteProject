    <h3><span>Top of the top. Mercedes-Benz W140</span></h3>
            <p style="padding: 3%; padding-top: 0%;">
                The Mercedes-Benz W140 is a series of flagship vehicles manufactured by Mercedes-Benz from 1991 to 1998 in sedan/saloon and coupe body styles and two 
                wheelbase lengths (SE and SEL). Mercedes-Benz unveiled the W140 S-Class at Geneva International Motor Show in March 1991 with sales launch in April 1991 
                and North American launch on 6 August 1991. All models were renamed in June 1993 as part of the corporate-wide nomenclature changes for 1994 model year on, 
                becoming "S" regardless of wheelbase length or body style as well as fuel type. Diesel models carried a TURBODIESEL trunk/boot lid label. In 1996, the S-Class 
                coupé was renamed again as CL-Class into its own model range.

            <p style="padding: 3%; padding-top: 0%;">
                The development on the W140 began in 1981, with official introduction originally set in September 1989. Several different design proposals were studied from 
                1982 until 1986, when a definitive design proposal by Olivier Boulay was selected on 9 December 1986. Several engineering prototypes were evaluated from early 
                1987, with the final exterior design locked in September 1987. The design patents were filed on 23 February 1988 in West Germany and 23 August 1988 in the United States.
                The lead designer Bruno Sacco attributed Jaguar's XJ40 sedan and BMW's E32 7-Series as a major influence in W140 design.

            The top end 600 SEL was so well engineered and constructed that it was also much more expensive and exclusive than the S Class sedan it replaced. 
            The Mercedes-Benz tagline of “The Best or Nothing” was never better exemplified than in the W140 S Class.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">
            Rumor has it that Mercedes spent an exorbitant $1 billion to design and engineer the W140, more than the company had ever spent on a single model. 
            This is an amazing amount of money to spend on a new car model, but the W140 S Class was an amazing car.

        Inside the flagship sedan, the engineers worked just as hard to make it one of the best living spaces in the world. Over 24 types of woods and various 
        leather materials were tested for over two years before finally arriving with a combination they were satisfied with. The California walnut wood and 
        leather were going to be the touchpoints on the vehicles they had to look good and feel good as well. It was also packed with some of the latest luxury 
        features of the time to make the operations as smooth as possible.

        The LS also features 300 extra innovations for smooth operation and improved silence in the cabin. An optional passive air suspension system was also 
        developed the make the ride even smoother. All these resulted in a very quiet cabin of 58 decibels at 60 MPH which was quieter than its equivalent rivals 
        from Mercedes and BMW. All at a cost of just $35,000 when it was launched in 1989. This undercut the competition by a huge margin as the equivalent BMW and 
        Mercedes cost around $60,000 and $70,000 respectively.

    Lexus had spent over a billion dollars in the development of the LS with approximately 450 prototypes built which resulted in such a phenomenal vehicle. 
    In its first year, it sold over 40,000 units but not without issues as 8,000 vehicles were recalled for defective wiring and overheated brake lights which 
    were all remedied in 20 days. The Lexus team had planned for any unforeseen occurrences and were swift to act as this was crucial to the success of the LS. 
    This earned Lexus a great reputation among its new customers and further aided in massive sales.

<p class="finishingparas" style="padding-top: 1%;"> 
    <span>Competitors bought the LS And tore it down to find out why it was so good and marveled at how Lexus could build such a high-quality vehicle at such a low price. 
    BMW even accused Lexus of selling the LS below the cost value to put them out of business. By 1990, sales of the LS in the US had surpassed that of Mercedes and 
    BMW which were the key competitors. The LS had succeeded in its mission and was the luxury car everyone wanted.

    Mercedes Launched the W140 S-class in 1991 which is considered one of the greatest Mercedes models of all time. But the budget was vastly exceeded on that car as 
    it was delayed and many revisions were made to best the Lexus LS. Chief engineer, Wolfgang Peter lost his job for this decision which later resulted in a much more
    expensive vehicle than its predecessor and way more expensive than the LS with a base price of $72,000 for entry-level cars. But Lexus would not rest as they made 
    a refresh to the LS In 1992 with over 50 new revisions based on customer feedback.

    <h3><span>A silky smooth V-8 engine</span></h3>

    <p style="padding: 3%; padding-top: 0%; padding-bottom: 0%;">      
        With its $1 billion development cost, Lexus made sure the LS shared no parts with any existing model and that included the engine. A flagship vehicle needed 
        a befitting engine and most cars in its class made use of a V-8 engine for smooth power delivery. About $400 million was spent on the development of the new 
        engine with 900 prototypes made. The final engine was the 4.0-liter 1UZ-FE naturally aspirated V-8 engine.

        Extensive testing was done on this engine in combination with all of its moving parts, suspension, and various mechanical components. Over 1.7 million miles 
        of testing was done on international soil in Europe, Australia, and the US in various weather conditions. This was to ensure the powertrain components 
        worked in all conditions and in harmony to deliver power as smoothly as possible. To show off the smoothness of this engine, Lexus famously made a commercial 
        stacking glasses of wine on the hood while the car was revving and they didn't topple over.

    <p style="padding: 3%; padding-top: 0%;">
        But this smoothness does not mean the LS400 was slow as it could hit 60 MPH in 8.5 seconds with a top speed of 155 MPH. It made use of a four-speed automatic 
        which sent all that power to the rear wheels. The engine and powertrain were geared towards smooth power delivery which in turn led to a quiet and relaxed 
        feeling inside the cabin. It was also a very reliable engine as it made the 2007 consumer reports list of cars that regularly exceeded 200,000 miles with proper
         maintenance. There's even the now infamous million-mile Lexus which is an LS400 that has driven over a million miles.
