        <h3><span>Lexus history: a lesson in luxury</span></h3>
                <p>
                    The arrival of the first Lexus vehicle in 1989 was a major landmark in the history of parent company Toyota. It marked the culmination of 
                    an unprecedented development programme which involved tens of thousands of hours and an uncalculated cost to build an all-new luxury vehicle 
                    that bettered the established marques at their own game. It simultaneously created a fitting figurehead for an all-new luxury brand.
                </p>

                <p class="bottom-p">
                    Toyota already had experience in premium quality vehicles, of course. Its production equipment was widely regarded as the best in the world, 
                    and the mass-produced Crown and hand-built Century limousine were luxury models that had been available for decades within the domestic market. 
                    But there was no single vehicle within Toyota’s line-up that possessed the important characteristics of prestige, quality, safety and performance 
                    that could also be considered world-leading and widely available.

        <h3><span>Three Decades Ago, Mercedes-Benz Launched the W140 S-Class</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Sometime during the 1990s, right after Lexus ate the German company’s lunch with the more affordable LS luxury sedan, is when Merc started cutting 
                    a few costs here and a few costs there, muddying its hard-earned renown. As far as the S-Class flagship sedan is concerned, the W140 is widely 
                    considered “the final proper S-Class” by the marque’s biggest fans.
                </p>

                <p class="bottom-p">
                    Introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1991, the third-generation Sonderklasse was penned by French designer Olivier Boulay and Italian designer 
                    Bruno Sacco with influences from the XJ40-generation Jaguar XJ and E32-generation BMW 7 Series. These competitors forced Mercedes to delay the W140 by 
                    roughly 18 months to redesign the engine compartment and to develop a V12 engine to properly compete with the XJ40 and E32.

        <h3><span>Gentlemen prefer Turbo's...</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Back in the 1980s, Bentley was close to being dropped by Vickers, which had taken over ownership at Crewe from the start of the decade. Rolls-Royce had 
                    all the allure, and Bentley, which should've offered a sporty alternative, was basically a badge-engineered product without the right badge. The Bentley 
                    Mulsanne Turbo put some distance between the brands, with the fitment of a large, Garrett T3 blower to the good-old 6.75-litre V8, but, while it added 
                    straight-line pace, the Mulsanne's boat-like cornering flawed any attempt at sportiness. The Turbo R sorted that out, and, from then on, Bentley soared - 
                    in both standing and sales.
                </p>

                <p class="bottom-p">
                    The R was for roadholding, and it added much-needed suspension enhancements that were dictated by then engineering director, Mike Dunn. These changes included 
                    stiffer anti-roll bars and firmer damping, along with a Panhard rod to limit the lateral movement of the rear subframe. It worked. Finally, Bentley had come 
                    up with a car that was powerful and, relatively speaking, wieldy.
